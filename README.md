# AndromedaLib
Open Source library for the First Robotics Competition.

This libarry has the objective of encouraging a functional coding process, focusing on making it easier and faster to write clean and effective code to iterate through ideas. This is done through the many wrappers it includes for many of WPILIB's classes. This library aims at removing bulky, verbose code and object initialization.  

AndromedaLib has been proven to work effectively by being constantly used by Team 6647, VOLTEC Robotics
